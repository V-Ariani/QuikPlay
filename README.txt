A simple web app where user can input the number of minutes they have free time, and depending on the duration of free time the app will 
suggest a song they can listen to. To reset their free time simply press 'reset' button.
Other feature includes sharing with facebook.

As per brief, the web app has the following:
Basic Features:
* Hosted and published on Microsoft Azure
* HTML5 / CSS for the UI (Responsive). We recommend Bootstrap.
* TypeScript for the logic, using dynamic API calls.
* Uses GitHub for Source Control, and Open Source
Advanced Features (at least 2 of these):
- Makes use of any two JQuery Plug-ins
* Implements Application Insights
* Implements Facebook Sharing, Login or Comments
* Continuous Deployment via GitHub
- Makes use of SASS
- Makes use of Gulp or Grunt

For the folks at MSA, thank you very much for providing this opportunity for me to develop my coding skills with this project. 
I think the brief was well thought of and is challenging without being too daunting, especially with the bootcamps. It was a great 
learning experience for me. I hope I may continue with this program so I may learn more and connect with industry professionals
as I complete this program.

Thank you very much, and enjoy the app!

Kind regards,

Vania
